This is a simple implementation of the event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and
the time-based TOTP algorithm (RFC6238).  I was facinated by these algorithm
and their adoption by huge businesses and companies for one-time password
generation, so I decided to write my own implementation of them for fun!
